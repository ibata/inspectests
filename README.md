# EC2 Instance - InSpec Profile

## Description

A library InSpec compliance profile containing a custom `ec2_instance` resource that can be used to test `meta-data` and `user-data` for AWS EC2 nodes. It does not require AWS API credentials since the resource is retrieving the data on the target ec2 nodes using the `http://169.254.169.254/` metadata API.

InSpec is an open-source run-time framework and rule language used to specify compliance, security, and policy requirements for testing any node in your infrastructure.

The controls you find in the `./controls` directory are sample ones to demonstrate how to use the `ec2_instance` resource.

### Requirements

* [InSpec](https://github.com/chef/inspec)

### Platforms

- Linux
- Windows

## Usage

- Add this to your profile's `inspec.yml` to ensure a correct InSpec version and define the profile dependency:

```yaml
supports:
  - inspec: '~> 1.0'
depends:
  - name: ec2-instance-profile
    git: https://github.com/alexpop/ec2-instance-profile
    version: '~> 0.1'
```

### Examples

- Use the `ec2_instance` resource in your profiles, the same way you'd use core InSpec resources like file, service, command, etc.

```ruby
control 'ec2-instance-1.1' do
  impact 1.0
  title 'Ensure no sensitive information is passed via the user-data'
  describe ec2_instance do
    it { should exist }
    its('user-data') { should_not match /password|secret.?access/i }
  end
end

control 'ec2-instance-1.2' do
  impact 0.6
  title 'Test the IP addresses by specifying meta-data API version'
  describe ec2_instance(version: '2016-06-30') do
    it { should exist }
    its('meta-data/public-ipv4') { should eq '' }
    its('meta-data/local-ipv4') { should match /^172\.31\..+/ }
  end
end
```


### `ec2_instance` resource parameters:

Name | Required | Type | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
version | no | String | Defaults to 'latest' if not specified. Call this on your EC2 instance to find out all available versions: `http://169.254.169.254/`
timeout | no | Numeric | Number of seconds to wait for the HTTP connection to open. The default value is 2 seconds.
curl_path | no | String | Defaults to `curl` in `$PATH` if not specified.
wget_path | no | String | Defaults to `wget` in `$PATH` if not specified.

An HTTP client is required on the target node in order for the resource to work. `curl`, `wget` and `Invoke-WebRequest`(Windows) are currently supported.

Example of instantiating the resource with a Hash of the above parameters:

```ruby
describe ec2_instance(version: '2016-06-30', timeout: 3, curl_path: '/usr/bin/curl') do
  it { should exist }
end
```


### `ec2_instance` resource tests:

```ruby
describe ec2_instance do
  # Returns true if the node is indeed an EC2 instance
  it { should exist }
  # Test the value returned by 'http://169.254.169.254/latest/SOMETHING', see examples below:
  its('SOMETHING') { should match /hello-world/i }
  # Test 'http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/local-ipv4' if we write:
  its('meta-data/public-ipv4') { should eq '' }
  # Test 'http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-id' if we write:
  its('meta-data/instance-id') { should match /^.{19}+$/ }
end
```
